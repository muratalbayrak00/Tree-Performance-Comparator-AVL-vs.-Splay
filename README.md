# Tree Performance Comparator: AVL vs. Splay

This project aims to compare the performance of AVL and Splay trees based on the criteria of the total number of 
comparisons and the number of rotations. The program reads characters from a text file, inserts non-existing ones 
as keys in the corresponding tree (AVL or Splay), and updates the occurrence frequency of existing ones. AVL tree 
maintains its balance after insertions by employing proper rotations when necessary, while Splay tree performs
necessary splays after each character read from the text.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  
2. Compile the program using ANSI C:

3. Run the program providing the input text file as an argument:

4. View the output, which displays the total cost of construction and search within both trees.
